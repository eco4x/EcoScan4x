Follow these steps to deploy ecoScan4x in your environment.

1. System Update & Dependencies
First, ensure your package manager is up to date and install the necessary tools (Git and Python).

Bash

pkg install git python -y

 For Linux/Ubuntu Users
sudo apt update && sudo apt install git python3 python3-pip -y
2. Clone the Repository
Download the project files from GitHub to your local machine.

Usage Guide
The tool is designed to be simple but powerful. You can scan a single site or a list of targets.

Option A: Single URL Scan
Best for a quick check of a specific domain's security posture.

Bash
python ecoScan4x.py google.com
Option B: Bulk Audit
If you have a file named targets.txt with a list of URLs, run:

Bash
python ecoScan4x.py targets.txt
Audit Results & Reporting
Every time you run a scan, ecoScan4x does two things:

Terminal Output: Displays a live risk assessment (Critical, Warning, or Secure) directly in your console.

JSON Audit Log: Automatically saves a timestamped file (e.g., audit_20260101_1200.json) in the project folder.

These JSON logs are designed to be used as ISO 27001 evidence for security audits. To view a saved report in Termux, use:

Bash
cat audit_*.json
